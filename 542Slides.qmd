## Canada's Investment Landscape
- 79% of Canadians recognize the importance of investing
- Only 48% actually invest annually
- Over half of those that don't invest state a fear of losing money
- **The Opportunity:** Low-risk investment options!

## What is a Term Deposit?
- A low-risk, stead way to grow your savings
- Money is locked in for a set duration, at a fixed interest rate
- At the end of term, the initial investment is returned plus interest earned

## Our Research Goal

**We aim to determine whether a machine learning model can predict if a customer will agree to open a term deposit**

-  This will lead to:
    - More targeted campaigns
    - Cost effectiveness
    - Improved customer relationships.

## The Dataset

- Dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Each row represents a bank client
- 17 features capturing client characteristics:
    - Age, marital status, education level, past interactions, days since last contact
- Binary target column

# Exploratory Data Analysis

---

## Target Variable Distribution
- 88.3% are non-subscribers.
- 11.7% are subscribers.
![](img/target_variable_distribution.png)
---

## Balance Distribution by Subscription Status
- Subscribers generally have higher balances compared to non-subscribers.
- There are significant outliers for both groups.
- Balance could be a strong predictor for subscription.

---

## Feature Densities by Class
- Comparing feature distributions between subscribers and non-subscribers:
    - Age: Subscribers are concentrated in middle-aged groups.
    - Balance: Subscribers tend to have higher balances.
    - Campaign: Fewer contact attempts are common for most clients.
---

## Correlation Heatmap
- Most features exhibit weak correlations.
- Moderate correlation observed between:
    - pdays (days since last contact) and previous (number of prior contacts).
- Minimal multicollinearity ensures model interpretability.
---

## Key Insights
- Dataset Imbalance:
    - Requires class balancing to improve predictions.
- Feature Selection:
    - Balance and contact-related features are likely key predictors.
- Preprocessing:
    - Addressed missing values and removed irrelevant features.

# The Model

---

## Logistic Regression Model Overview

- **Why Logistic Regression?**
  - Simple and interpretable model for binary classification.
  - Useful for understanding key predictors for term deposit subscription.

- **Key Features Used in the Model:**
  - **Balance**: Higher balances indicate higher likelihood of subscription.
  - **Campaign and Previous Contact**: Capture customer interactions.
  - **Contact Method**: Includes phone and unknown categories.

---

## Handling Dataset Imbalance

- **Challenge**:
  - The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 11.7% subscribers.
  - Without addressing this, the model would overpredict non-subscribers.

- **Solution**:
  - Applied class balancing techniques:
    - Oversampling the minority class (subscribers).
    - Weight adjustments to penalize misclassification of subscribers.

---

## Model Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Standardized numerical features (e.g., balance, age).
   - One-hot encoded categorical variables (e.g., job, education, contact).

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Binary classification model with sigmoid activation.
   - Outputs probabilities for subscription likelihood.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Grid search for optimal regularization (`C` parameter).
   - Evaluated using cross-validation on training data.

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Key Metrics Used**:
  - **Precision**: Focus on positive predictions (subscribers).
  - **Recall**: Measure of sensitivity for subscriber identification.
  - **AUC-ROC**: Overall performance across thresholds.

- **Why These Metrics?**
  - Precision and recall balance is critical for imbalanced datasets.
  - AUC-ROC provides a broader perspective on model performance.

---

## Model Limitations

- **Dataset Imbalance**:
  - Precision remains low for the minority class (subscribers).
  - Results in higher false positives, increasing marketing costs.

- **Model Simplicity**:
  - Logistic regression may not capture non-linear patterns or complex relationships.

- **Feature Limitations**:
  - Lack of transaction history and economic indicators reduces predictive power.
