## Canada's Investment Landscape
- 79% of Canadians recognize the importance of investing
- Only 48% actually invest annually
- Over half of those that don't invest state a fear of losing money
- **The Opportunity:** Low-risk investment options!

---

## What is a Term Deposit?
- A low-risk, steady way to grow your savings
- Keeps initial investment secure

## Our Research Goal

**We aim to determine whether a machine learning model can predict if a customer will agree to open a term deposit**

-  This will lead to:
    - More targeted campaigns
    - Cost effectiveness
    - Improved customer relationships.

## Limitations
-  Key Points:
    - Dataset Imbalance: Significant imbalance affects precision.
    Precision Issues: Low precision for term deposit subscribers.
    Model Scope: Logistic regression may not capture complex relationships.
    Feature Limitations: Lack of features like transaction history impacts performance.

---

## Practical Implications

- Applications:
    - Optimize marketing strategies using model predictions.
    - Efficient resource allocation.

- Challenges:
    - Low precision increases costs by targeting non-subscribers.
    - Improvements in precision are needed for better efficiency.

---

## Future Research Directions

- Suggestions:
    1) Advanced Models: Use Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines to improve precision and accuracy.
    2) Additional Features: Include transaction history or customer engagement metrics.
    3) Economic Context: Integrate external factors such as interest rates or market conditions.
